## How to Use

### Building Totems

**Approach a totem site** - The plugin will automatically detect which site you're at

**Start building** - Click "Build" on an empty totem pole

### Carving Animals
**Start carving** - The plugin remembers the correct animals

**Use the dialog** - Correct animals are highlighted in green

**Track progress** - Carved animals lose their highlight and appear gray in the popup

### Following Ent Trails

**Enable trail highlighting** - Ent Trails appear with green overlay (Currently Broken)
**Follow the paths** - Trails show where Ents have recently walked
**Find active Ents** - Fresh trails lead to Ents you can chop

## Tips

- üìç You must be within 10 tiles of a totem for the plugin to track it
- üåø Ent Trails spawn dynamically - they appear as Ents move around

## Troubleshooting

### Animals not highlighting?
- Make sure you've talked to the foresters first
- Verify you're at a totem site (within 10 tiles)
- Check that "Highlight Dialog Options" is enabled

### Wrong totem site detected?
- The plugin uses your proximity to determine the site
- Move closer to the totem you want to work on
- Enable debug mode to see distance calculations

### Ent Trails not showing?
- Verify "Highlight Ent Trails" is enabled
- Trails only appear where Ents have recently walked
- Some areas may not have active Ents

## Technical Details

### Varbit Tracking
The plugin tracks totem states using game varbits:
- Points per site
- Decay timers
